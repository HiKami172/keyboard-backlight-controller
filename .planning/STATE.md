## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: TUF F16 only, no multi-model support — simpler for personal use
- [Init]: udev rule with RUN+chgrp/chmod (NOT GROUP=/MODE= — unreliable on sysfs attribute files)
- [Init]: Full GTK4 window + AppIndicator3 tray — window for setup, tray for daily switching
- [Phase 1]: Confirm actual sysfs path with `ls /sys/class/leds/asus*` on hardware before any code
- [Phase 4]: Validate gi.repository.AppIndicator3 import path on Ubuntu 24.04 before implementing tray

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: GNOME Shell requires `gnome-shell-extension-appindicator` for tray icons — must detect and surface user-facing error if missing
- [Phase 4]: Confirm trayer vs. direct AppIndicator3 GObject introspection binding during Phase 4 planning
- [Phase 5]: Wayland global hotkeys (KEYS-01, KEYS-02) — XDG Desktop Portal Global Shortcuts API not fully researched; may hit implementation constraints
